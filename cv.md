## Summary:

All my life, I've spent time at the computer. And I always wanted to work on a computer. Learn new _technologies_ and _use them_. I think programming is the best choice. I tried web development and loved it. I decided to study **JavaScript** as a language. I studied on my own for several months and now it's time to go deeper. I decided to take courses from the **_RS school_**.

## Skills:

- [x] Vanilla JavaScript

## Code examples:

```js
function accum(s) {
  let count = 0;
  let str = s[0];
  
  for (i = 1; i < s.length; i++){
    count++;
    str = str + '-';
    for(k = 0; k <= count; k++){
      str+=s[i];
    }
  }
  
  let up = str.toLowerCase().split('-').map(function (el){
    return el[0].toUpperCase() + el.substr(1);
  });
      
  return up.join('-');
}
```
